# Intelligent Reporting

**Intelligent Reporting** is an automated analytics framework designed to bridge the gap between raw data metrics and human understanding. It leverages AI-driven summarization to transform operational and data quality metrics into dynamic, readable insights.

## Architecture

The project is structured as a full-stack application:

- **Backend**: Python-based API utilizing **Flask** (`app.py`) for handling data processing and summarization requests.
- **Frontend**: Built with **TypeScript** to provide an interactive dashboard for viewing reports.
- **AI Engine**: Integrates AI models to analyze data quality metrics and generate natural language summaries.

## Key Features

- **Automated Summarization**: Uses AI to generate natural language summaries of complex data sets.
- **Data Quality Focus**: specifically designed to handle and interpret data quality metrics.
- **Dynamic Insights**: Transforms static numbers into actionable narratives.
- **Full-Stack Implementation**: Seamless integration between a robust Python backend and a typed frontend interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python (83%), TypeScript (14%)
- **Backend Framework**: Flask
- **Frontend**: TypeScript
- **Scripting**: Automation scripts for report generation
